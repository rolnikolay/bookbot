# bookbot

bookbot is a project built as part of the boot.dev course

# How to use

It is a CLI command that will count the number of characters and give you a split of characters.
Example:
![example how to use](public/readme/example_of_use.png)

To get things going:

1. Install python3
2. clone this repo
3. Run the CLI command:

```
python3 main.py {path_to_the_book}
```

![run command python3 main.py books/prideandprejudice.txt](public/readme/image.png)

## Notes for future

This is not a fancy CLI tool, rather a quick script to get things done.

In future add some description, --help, maybe some features like show top N characters (like --top, with default 10, otherwise shows all).

Fancy tool.
